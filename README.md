## Local Internet of Things architecture
Clear and simple architecture to setup a local Internet of Things environment in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). (Interactive Application, technical seminar)

### Abstract
With this technical seminar I want to explore and document a clear and secure way of setting up a local interconnected architecture of machines, actors and humans (Internet of Things). My focus lies on creating a local, closed system, to provide data protection and security. In the end the architecture should be a part of a distributed system of multiple architectures, which on occasion may share information between each other.

In this technical seminar I will continue working on a project called 'Lifecycle' where we are working on decentralized indoor food production with computer aided aquaponics. Nevertheless the environment's architecture can be used for all kind of different purposes.

### Basic architecture
The communication of the environment is based on the machine-to-machine protocol [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/). It is extremely lightweight and builds upon simple publish/subscribe messaging transport. The Raspberry Pi acts as the main component â€” it handels the communication between the Web application and the Actors/Sensors ([Johnny-Five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five), [Node Serialport](https://github.com/node-serialport/node-serialport)) via serving a http- and the mqtt-server ([Mosca](https://github.com/mcollina/mosca)).

```
Web application -> Raspberry Pi -> Arduino(s) -> Actors/Sensors
Actors/Sensors -> Arduino -> Raspberry Pi -> Web application

Web application (html, css, vanilla js, mqtt.js)
Raspberry Pi (Raspbian, Node.js, Mosca, Johnny-Five)  
Arduino (StandardFirmataPlus, OpenAquaponics)
```

### Installing local-iot-architecture

The environment is build with the JavaScript runtime [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

#### Installing Node.js

To install Node.js we are using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). It's pretty straight forward and allows you to easily switch node versions if needed.

```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.8/install.sh | bash
```

Then we install the lastest node version

```shell
nvm install latest
```
> If `nvm` isn't found run your `~/.bashrc` file once.

To check your node version just

```shell
node -v
```

#### Cloning the repository

To get local-iot-architecture version 1.0.0 we clone from here

```bash
git clone git@github.com:cccccccccccccccccnrd/local-iot-architecture.git
```

and install the node modules with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) which came with the Node.js installation

```bash
npm install
```

#### Starting the application

To start the environment simply execute the `index.js` file with node.

```bash
node index.js
```

### Configuring local-iot-architecture

The basic dataflow starts with initialazing the Arduino board

```js
const board = new five.Board({
  port: '/dev/ttyACM1' 
})

board.on('ready', function () {
  ...
})
```
> If you have just have one board connected you don't have to specify the port.

we setup a sensor or actor as a Johnny-Five component class

```js
photocell = new five.Light({
  pin: 'A3',
  freq: 2000
})
```
> Take a look at the [Johnny-Five documentation](http://johnny-five.io/api/).

and its topic and state for the MQTT protocol.

```js
const lightIntensityTopic = 'sensor/light-intensity'
let lightIntensityState
```

When the sensor sends new data we assign its `type`, `value` and `timestamp` to the state object and publish it to the MQTT stream in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format so the Web application can process it further.

```js
photocell.on('data', function() {
  lightIntensityState = {
    'type': 'light-intensity',
    'value': Math.floor(100 - this.level * 100),
    'timestamp': Date.now()
  }
  client.publish(lightIntensityTopic, JSON.stringify(lightIntensityState))
})
```
